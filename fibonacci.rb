# Project: Fibonacci solved recursively for The Odin Project
# Author: Luj√°n Fernaud
#
# Instructions:
#
# 1. Write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns that many members
# of the fibonacci sequence. Use iteration for this solution.
#
# 2. Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem
# recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you're crazy,
# but don't consider either of these lengths a requirement... just get it done).

def fibs_rec(number)
  number < 2 ? number : fibs_rec(number - 2) + fibs_rec(number - 1)
end

puts fibs_rec(10)
